# StartLoc

StartLoc is a simple tool that allows you to set a dynamic starting location for your terminal sessions. It supports both Zsh and Bash.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `install_startloc.sh` script directly.
2. Run the script with `bash install_startloc.sh`.
3. Open a new terminal session, or source your shell configuration file with either `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`.

## Usage
